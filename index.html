                            <p>Gomenasai, my name is Vergil-Dono.
                                <br>
                                I'm a 45 year old half-demon samurai (swordsman for you gaijins). I wrote poetry on my
                                book, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior Japanese games. (Samurai
                                Shodown, Final Fantasy, Sekiro)
                                I train with my Yamato every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel
                                because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other devil
                                arm. I acquired my sword when I was 8, and I have been getting better every day.
                                I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as
                                well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow
                                100%
                                When I acquire my father's sword, I am moving to the underworld to fight more powerful
                                demons and get more power. I hope I can defeat my brother or the demon king Mundus
                                I own several long trenchcoats, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing
                                them before I move to the demon world, so I can fit in easier. I attack my brother and
                                son and quote poetry as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.
                                Wish me luck in the demon world!
